My ~~remake~~ of Asteroids, the game

Also, text is hard :(, so I just didn't do it.


## Tips

- You can only have 32 projectiles at a time, so don't click lots in the middle of the window.
- You can press F3, to show some stats & game ID, if you'd like to share your score and look legimate.
- I'm pretty sure, enemies at the top of the screen are faster in this version too, so keep your cursor there, unless your going for sick 180 flick trickshots!
- The tail of your projectiles actually register hits with enemies, so, even if an enemy is closer to you, than your projectiles length, you can still shoot em'.
- Quite obvious, but your cursor's distance from the center affects your projectile's speed.
